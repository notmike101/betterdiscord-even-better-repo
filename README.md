6. Restart betterDiscord

## How To Use

## To Add Your Theme/Plugin To The Repo
Due to the underlying conflicts in Git's pull request streamline, managing too many will become extremely tedious.
From this point, please submit "Issues" with the content that you want added using the following template:
```
Theme/Plugin Name:
Theme/Plugin Author:
Theme/Plugin Repo URL:
Theme/Plugin Direct URL:
Theme/Plugin Description: 
```

## To Do List

* Add actual version checking so users won't always see an update button if there is no update
* More error catching!
* Mac implementation (Later)
* Linux implementation (Even later)
